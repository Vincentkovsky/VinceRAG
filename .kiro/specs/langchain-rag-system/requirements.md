# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build a professional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using LangChain as the core AI framework and Vue.js as the frontend user interface. The system will allow users to upload various document formats, add web links, conduct intelligent Q&A, and receive accurate answers based on the content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Document and Content Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage various types of documents and web links so that the system can answer my questions based on this content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects document files THEN system SHALL support PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, RTF format file uploads
2. WHEN user inputs web URL THEN system SHALL crawl web contentï¼Œrelevant web URL content and extract text information
3. WHEN user adds web link THEN system SHALL validate URL validity and display web page title and summary
4. WHEN document or web page is successfully added THEN system SHALL display content list including name, type, size/URL, added time, processing status
5. WHEN user clicks delete content THEN system SHALL remove the content from storage and vector database
6. IF document format is not supported or web page cannot be accessed THEN system SHALL display specific error messages
7. WHEN user adds duplicate content THEN system SHALL detect and notify user that content already exists
8. WHEN user batch uploads files THEN system SHALL support drag-and-drop multiple files simultaneously

### Requirement 2 - Document Processing and Vectorization

**User Story:** As a system, I need to convert uploaded documents and web content into vector representations for semantic search and retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document upload is completed THEN system SHALL automatically extract document text content
2. WHEN web link is added THEN system SHALL crawl and clean web page text content
3. WHEN text extraction is completed THEN system SHALL split content into appropriately sized text chunks
4. WHEN text splitting is completed THEN system SHALL use embedding model to generate vector representations
5. WHEN vector generation is completed THEN system SHALL store vectors in vector database
6. IF document processing fails THEN system SHALL log error and notify user
7. WHEN processing large documents THEN system SHALL display progress bar
8. WHEN content is updated THEN system SHALL support incremental re-indexing

### Requirement 3 - Intelligent Q&A

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions and receive accurate answers based on uploaded documents and web content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user inputs question THEN system SHALL retrieve relevant document segments from vector database
2. WHEN relevant segments are retrieved THEN system SHALL use LLM to generate context-based answers
3. WHEN answer generation is completed THEN system SHALL display answer content and cited document sources
4. WHEN citing web content THEN system SHALL display original web page links
5. IF no relevant content is found THEN system SHALL notify user that no relevant information was found
6. WHEN user sends new question THEN system SHALL maintain conversation history
7. WHEN user asks about specific document THEN system SHALL support filtering search by document source
8. WHEN generating answer THEN system SHALL support streaming output display

### Requirement 4 - User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and easy-to-use interface to manage documents, web links, and conduct Q&A.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses system THEN system SHALL display clear document upload area and URL input box
2. WHEN user uploads document or adds link THEN system SHALL display processing progress and status
3. WHEN user enters Q&A interface THEN system SHALL provide chat-style interactive interface
4. WHEN system generates answer THEN interface SHALL display answer content in streaming fashion
5. WHEN user views answer THEN system SHALL display relevant document source links or citations
6. WHEN user manages content THEN system SHALL provide search, filter, and sort functionality
7. WHEN user accesses on mobile device THEN interface SHALL maintain responsive design
8. WHEN user operates interface THEN system SHALL provide clear loading states and feedback

### Requirement 5 - System Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure system parameters to optimize RAG system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN system SHALL load LLM and embedding model settings from configuration file
2. WHEN administrator modifies configuration THEN system SHALL support hot reloading of configuration parameters
3. WHEN system runs THEN system SHALL log query logs and performance metrics
4. IF configuration parameters are invalid THEN system SHALL use default configuration and log warnings
5. WHEN system processes requests THEN system SHALL implement appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN administrator views system status THEN system SHALL provide monitoring dashboard showing system health
7. WHEN configuring model parameters THEN system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)

### Requirement 6 - Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and handle large amounts of documents and web content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits question THEN system SHALL return initial response within 5 seconds
2. WHEN system processes multiple concurrent requests THEN system SHALL maintain stable response times
3. WHEN document count increases THEN system SHALL support incremental index updates
4. WHEN querying vector database THEN system SHALL implement efficient similarity search
5. IF system load is too high THEN system SHALL implement request queuing and rate limiting
6. WHEN processing large documents THEN system SHALL support asynchronous processing and background tasks
7. WHEN storing vector data THEN system SHALL support data persistence and backup recovery

### Requirement 7 - Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my documents and data to be securely protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user uploads document THEN system SHALL validate file type and size limits
2. WHEN user adds web link THEN system SHALL validate URL security to avoid malicious links
3. WHEN system stores data THEN system SHALL implement encrypted data storage
4. WHEN user accesses system THEN system SHALL implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. IF malicious content is detected THEN system SHALL block processing and log security events
6. WHEN user deletes data THEN system SHALL ensure complete data removal
7. WHEN system processes sensitive information THEN system SHALL follow data protection best practices
